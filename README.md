# CHILD
**Channel-Hillslope Integrated Landscape Development Model**

CHILD is a model of landscape evolution for simulating the development of landscapes under various tectonic, litholoigc, and climatic boundary conditions.

This is a modified version of the CHILD model that you can get from [CSDMS](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Model:CHILD). **In this spin-off version, the storm-generating module has been greatly expanded**. There is also a [github project](https://github.com/childmodel/child) of the original model, however, I am not sure it is under active development at the minute as the repo has not been updated for a couple of years. You may see these changes merged back into the upstream model one day, but for now, here they are in a standalone repository. 

If you have questions about the CHILD model in general, I suggest you refer to the CSDMS page and the original model developers.
